: Is MPlace2 part of Bluesky Social?

:: No, MPlace2 has no connection to Bluesky, it is a separate social space provided
by Threshold Secrets LLC.

: Can I run my own MPlace2 server?

:: MPlace2 is the name of a social media space built using the Palimpsest social media
server. You cannot run your own MPlace2 but you can run your own Palimpsest 
service with all the same features by installing the open source server distribution
running on Windows, macOS or Linux.

: I already have a Web forum, can I use the software MPlace2 uses to go accountless?

:: The @nything accountless login is built with open standards and proposed standards
and could in principle be used with any Web forum software. But this would require
support to be added by the provider of the Web forum hosting software you are using.

:: Threshold Secrets LLC. is available to provide consulting services to assist with such
efforts but these are at a commerical rate which is unlikely to be economic for 
individual forums unless these are very large.
