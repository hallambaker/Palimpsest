MPlace2 is a social media space designed to compliment the Bluesky Social microblogging 
service with personal pages and private groups. It is intended to provide both
a proof of concept for complimentary services accessible to the Bluesky community 
and as a standalone service in its own right.

Unlike traditional social media spaces which require users to create a new account 
to log in, MPlace2 makes use of OAUTH2 to allow users to log in using their AT Protocol
handle.
